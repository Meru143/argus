# Argus TODO

## Tier 1 — Post-Launch Differentiators

- Feedback learning (thumbs up/down on comments, stored locally, tune prompts) — retention driver
- Security review mode (`--profile security`) — OWASP/CWE tagging, enterprise/compliance market
- Local LLM support (Ollama/any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) — #1 reason for open-source over CodeRabbit
- Incremental review — only re-review new changes after a push, reduces noise and cost

## Tier 3 — Polish

- miette error messages — beautiful diagnostics instead of raw anyhow
- README overhaul — logo, badges, SVG screencast, comparison table, "Why Argus?" section
